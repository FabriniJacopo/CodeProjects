# Gender Recognition app
This project was developed during the course "Multimedial Application and Future's Internet" by Jacopo Fabrini and Walter Cesarini with the help of Eng. Andrea Sciarrone.
This is an Android Application that use the competences of signal processing acquired in the others engineering courses.
The app record the voice of the user and after a Fourier Elaboration in order to extract the pitch frequency it should determine the gender of the user.
The application in its embrional form needs to be trained by voice of both genders, the value extracted by the training process are stored in a .txt file in the phone storage.
Because the pitch extraction is not a particularly good method to determine the gender of the user, in a lot of case the result will be wrong.

All the code written by us is contained in src/com.

This repository contains only the code of the app, if you're interested for any reason in the full project feel free to contact us at jacopo.fabrini@gmail.com or cesaw93@hotmail.it
